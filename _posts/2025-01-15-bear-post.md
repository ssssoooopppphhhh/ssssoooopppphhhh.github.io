  It’s currently mid January, the perfect time to do some reflecting on cold adaptation (in the northern hemisphere). Last fall, I helped to teach an intro biology class. During a lecture on aerobic respiration, the professor mentioned how hibernating bears use specialized mitochondrial proteins called uncouplers to uncouple the oxidation of molecules from ATP generation, allowing them to disperse the energy released from breaking down food and warm their bodies. As someone with an unchecked obsession with all carnivoran species, a research interest in membrane proteins, and a cozy blanket under a toasty laptop in front of a heater, I decided to go down the rabbit hole (bear den? squirrel nest??) of mitochondrial uncoupling.
Black bears (Ursus americanus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) are famous hibernators. Of course, other organisms hibernate too. And plenty of animals arguably commit harder to the process - the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) essentially allows its body to freeze solid for months (1,2). But although bears rest all winter without eating/drinking/excreting waste and exhibit all sorts of insane adaptations (3) to keep themselves alive, they don’t experience the drastic body temperature drop observed in their fellow hibernators. I wondered if these magical mitochondrial uncoupler proteins I had learned about might be the key to the reasonable body temperatures of bears in the depths of winter.
  The first step in understanding uncoupling is understanding mitochondria, the wonderful little critters-turned-organelles that provide (almost) all eukaryotic cells with abundant chemical energy in the form of ATP. Luckily, since I recently had to drill the fundamentals of cellular respiration into the heads of 93 unfortunate souls, we find ourselves in a fleeting window of time during which I have some recollection of how these things work. Mitochondria have two membranes (lipid bilayers), one on the outside and one sort of crumpled up on the inside. During respiration, carbon sources (lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids) are oxidized and the electrons that pop out are carried to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, they are used by a series of transmembrane protein complexes to pump protons (H+s) across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space. The energy that originated in food (salmon, huckleberries, hot italian sausage) has now been converted to potential energy in the form of a proton gradient! The best analogy for this gradient is water held by a dam at the top of a hill. A spectacular protein called ATP synthase is our water wheel - protons do work by flowing through it down their concentration gradient and causing it to turn. With every turn, ATP synthase synthesizes molecules of ATP, the energy currency of the cell.
  How efficient is this process? I don’t know. It depends. But certainly never 100% efficient. The mitochondrial inner membrane is riddled with transmembrane proteins doing all sorts of jobs including moving all the molecules involved in all of these processes in and out of the innermost compartment known as the mitochondrial matrix. It makes a lot of sense (and has been experimentally shown) that protons regularly find sneaky ways to bypass ATP synthase and leak down their concentration gradient, reducing the efficiency of the whole ATP generation process (4). When this happens, the energy released during respiration is (famously) not destroyed! Instead of being captured in the bonds of ATP molecules, it is dispersed as thermal energy - bad if you need lots of ATP, but perhaps good if you’re chilly.
  There is indeed a protein called Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) whose job is letting protons escape down their concentration gradient into the mitochondrial matrix. There are plenty of (extremely dangerous) drugs you can take which function similarly and there may be other genetically encoded uncouplers out there but as far as I can tell Ucp1 is the only well-characterized natural protein whose role is to dissipate the mitochondrial proton motive force (4). Ucp1, which spans the inner membrane, uses anionic long chain fatty acids to move protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix side of the membrane. The exact mechanism for this trick is disputed. In the first model, Ucp1 stays continuously bound to the fatty acid and uses it as a little spatula to flip protons across the bilayer (5). In the second (whackier-sounding) model, Upc1 simply releases fatty acids into the intermembrane space and lets them do all the work of moving back through the bilayer and delivering protons to the matrix themselves (6). Either way, the ultimate result is that the oxidation of food molecules results in warmth instead of ATP.
  Ucp1 is found in high quantities in the abundant, brown mitochondria of brown adipocytes, the cells that make up brown adipose tissue. Unlike white adipose tissue (what we’re normally referring to when we talk about fat), whose purpose is to store energy-rich, oxidizable lipids, the primary role of brown adipose tissue is to generate heat. Brown adipose tissue is surrounded by blood vessels that allow blood warmed by the efforts of Ucp1 to circulate around an animal’s body. This whole process is known as non-shivering thermogenesis.
So. Do hibernating bears undergo more non-shivering thermogenesis (and have more brown adipose tissue with more Ucp1) than other animals? We all know that bears gain huge quantities of fat in preparation for hibernation, but I haven’t actually been able to find any reports that any significant portion of this fat is specifically brown. I was able to find UniProt entries for black bear and polar bear Ucp1 proteins (it seems to exist), but haven’t found evidence that the gene encoding Ucp1 is highly expressed in bears during any season. Looks like we probably lied to the intro biology students…
  So who actually uses Ucp1? Turns out it’s mainly those little rodenty hibernators like the thirteen-lined ground squirrel I mentioned - they depend on Ucp1 and large amounts of brown adipose tissue to survive periodically thawing out (7). A cool study also showed that hibernating ground squirrels upregulate Upc1 in the mitochondria of their neurons, so that they can still maintain some awareness of their surroundings while being frozen (1). 
Human babies (and perhaps bear babies?) also seem to possess large amounts of brown adipose tissue (8,9). As we grow up, we gradually lose our (probably glorious) capacity to perform non-shivering thermogenesis. Adult humans only have tiny sprinklings of brown adipose tissue around our collars and important organs. For those of us who are particularly cold-sensitive, our only hope is to develop a few of the benign brown adipose tumors delightfully dubbed hibernomas.
  Most placental mammals (including all carnivorans) do have a somewhat functional (although perhaps rarely expressed) Ucp1 gene. However! Genomic analyses have shown that some giant mammals (e.g. elephants), some particularly blubbery mammals (e.g. whales), and some weirdos like pigs and pangolins have completely lost the ability to express Ucp1 (10). To make it all even more complicated, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is not a placental mammal or even “warm-bloooded”, does in fact upregulate an ortholog of Ucp1, which has been confirmed to function as a mitochondrial uncoupler, in its brain and liver in response to cold conditions (11). As per usual, what I thought would be a little foray into a “fun fact” I heard in lecture left me with far more questions than answers. We can only hope that the students in that class retain as little information on respiration as I did in college and don’t go around spreading misinformation about hibernating bears and their miraculous uncouplers. 
Stay warm out there.
