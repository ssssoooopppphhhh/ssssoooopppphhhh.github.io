title: "the slippery science of pluralS"

<p>Scientists can be a judgemental bunch. And I don’t think that’s always a bad thing - we are trained to be critical so that we can separate real signals from noise and evidence-based conclusions from biased or misguided pseudoscience. When I tripped over the word “jasplakinolide” in a presentation last year it rightfully triggered alarm bells in my audience: <i>If she didn’t take the time to practice the terminology, what other aspects of her work does she half-ass?</i> That being said, of course there are plenty of reasons someone might make a linguistic error that have no bearing on their ability to do great science. Scrutinizing the language of scientific writers or speakers quickly becomes problematic.</p>

<p>My personal potentially-problematic pet peeve as an audience member or editor is the misuse of singular and plural forms of words. The following is a list of words (singular and plural) that I have seen regularly misused even by big shot native-English-speaker academics. Although the majority of these words follow a simple set of rules derived from Latin, the exceptions are numerous enough that compiling this list granted me some newfound empathy for those who bungle them.</p>

<p><strong>-um:</strong></p>

<p>this datum -> these data</p>
 	<blockquote style="margin-top: 0;">
  Starting off with the big one.
</blockquote>

<p>this punctum -> these puncta
	<p>Punctate is also a nice adjective</p>

<p>this spectrum -> these spectra</p>

<p>this lamellipodium -> these lamellipodia (latin and greek): lamella “sheet” pod “foot”
	<p>This one comes from both Latin and Greek! Lamella is Latin for “plate or sheet” and pod is Greek for “foot”</p>

<p>this bacterium -> these bacteria</p>

<p>this medium -> these media</p>

<p>this cilium -> these cilia</p>

<p>this minimum -> these minima
	<p>Also maximum.</p>

<p><strong>-us:</strong></p>

<p>this focus -> these foci</p>

<p>this locus -> these loci</p>

<p>this radius -> these radii</p>

<p>this nucleus -> these nuclei
	<p>It’s Latin for “kernel”</p>

<p>this genus -> these genera
	<p>This comes from Latin just like the ones above so why doesn’t it become “generi”? The answer is (obviously) that it’s a 3rd-declension noun instead of a 2nd declension noun!</p>

<p>this virus -> these viruses
	<p>This also has Latin origins, but it used to be a mass noun like “blood” which didn’t have a plural. That’s why it got the English plural when it gained its modern meaning.</p>

<p>this octopus -> these octopuses/octopodes
	<p>This one’s Greek, so “octopi” is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>-a:</strong></p>

<p>this amoeba -> these amoebae/amoebas</p>

<p>this alga -> these algae</p>

<p>this larva -> these larvae</p>

<p><strong>-on:</strong></p>

<p>this phenomenon -> these phenomena</p>

<p>this criterion -> these criteria</p>

<p>this taxon -> these taxa</p>

<p><strong>other:</strong></p>

<p>this helix -> these helices</p>

<p>this homolog/homologue -> these homologs/homologues (Greek)</p>

<p>this metazoan -> these metazoans
	<p>The group is Metazoa.</p>

<p>this protozoan -> these protozoa
	<p>Why is it different from metazoan?? Who knows. Some people do seem to use “protozoans”.</p>

<p>this umwelt -> these umwelten
	<p>Taken from the German word for “environment” by Jakob Johann von Uexküll. Since I’m used to this word in its original context in which it would never be pluralized, “umwelten” kind of bothers me. The plural of “welt” (“world”) is “welten” so I do think it’s correct.</p>

<p>this species -> these species
	<p>Same same! Latin.</p>

<p>this moose -> these moose
	<p>Same same! This one came to American English from an Algonquian language. Turns out it’s pretty common for animal words to have invariant plurals: caribou (also Algonquian), sheep, trout, deer, cod, elk, reindeer, salmon, bison, squid.</p>
